## 📢 Project Introduction

A total of five languages can be set up: Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Uzbek, and English, which were selected in the order of countries with a high proportion of migrant workers living in Korea. The language can be changed at any time by tapping the global icon. 

You can view the pdf created to help migrant workers. Pdf in various languages are provided, and institutional guidance for migrant workers to ask for help and the status of migrant workers' industrial accidents are written. In the Q&A section, migrant workers often ask and wonder about things so that they can easily see them by category. 

You can check the contents of laws and regulations by category. In addition, even if the keyword is not entered only in Korean but in the user's native language, it is possible to search for laws by category. In the contract tab, when an image is recognized, text is extracted and can be translated and shown. 

With these features, our apps have the potential to help us regain the right to enjoy universal human rights.


## 📌 Our Goal

We became interested in the poor working environment and inequality of migrant workers after reading an article about 6,700 migrant workers killed in the last 10 years in Qatar, the host country of the 2022 World Cup.
Workers' rights must be protected worldwide. Therefore, this app was developed to help guarantee the rights of migrant workers who are in need of better treatment.
